# EDA Project: Exploratory Data Analysis
This repository contains three projects that focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using different datasets. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves analyzing and summarizing datasets to gain insights and identify patterns. The primary goal of EDA is to understand the data, detect anomalies, and generate hypotheses for further analysis.

# Why EDA?
Performing EDA helps in understanding the underlying structure and characteristics of the data. It allows us to identify relationships between variables, spot outliers, handle missing values, and explore correlations. EDA plays a vital role in decision-making, feature selection, and model building in various domains, including finance, real estate, and entertainment.

# Projects:

- Foreign Exchange Rates Analysis:
In this project, we investigate foreign exchange rates, starting with a general overview and then focusing on the Euro and Brazil Real currencies. We use the pct_change() function to calculate percentage changes and explore trends in the exchange rates. The project concludes with a summary of the findings.

- Houses to Rent Analysis:
This project examines the factors influencing house rental prices. We analyze the dataset based on the number of rooms, area, city, and other relevant features. By performing basic descriptions, handling missing values, and investigating outliers and correlations, we gain insights into the relationship between house attributes and rental prices.

- Netflix Titles Analysis:
In this project, we explore the relationships between different features in the Netflix Titles dataset. By conducting basic descriptions, handling missing values, and investigating outliers and correlations, we gain insights into patterns and associations among various attributes. This analysis helps us understand the characteristics of the Netflix content library.
Each project follows a similar approach:

Basic Description and Handling of Missing Values: We start by gaining a basic understanding of the dataset's structure and handling any missing values.
Basic Descriptions: We explore key statistics, distributions, and visualizations to gain insights into the data.
Outliers and Correlation: We investigate outliers and analyze correlations between variables to identify any interesting relationships.
